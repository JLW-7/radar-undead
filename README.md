An interactive zombie radar game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Radar Display**: A semicircular radar shows approaching zombies with real-time angle and distance updates.  
- **Arduino Integration**: Zombies can spawn randomly based on objects detected by an Arduino sensor.  
- **Interactive Shooting**: Click on the radar to shoot zombies and earn points.  
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard modes affect zombie spawn rates and challenge.  
- **Health Management**: Zombies reaching the center zone reduce player health. Game ends when health reaches zero.  
- **Immersive Audio**: Custom gunshot, zombie hit, groans, victory, and game-over sounds using Web Audio API.  
- **Responsive Visual Effects**: Pulsing zombies, distance indicators, and center danger zone highlights.  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** ‚Äì Game structure and canvas rendering  
- **CSS3** ‚Äì Styling, animations, and feedback effects  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** ‚Äì Game logic, radar mechanics, zombie management, Arduino communication, audio handling  
- **Web Audio API** ‚Äì Custom sound effects and music generation  
- **Web Serial API** ‚Äì Arduino connection and sensor data input  

## How To Play

I wouldn't say this is a serious project, it's simply a game I built for a Grade 8 STEAM class assignment. I mean you'll probably need a complete Arduino kit to play, but if you really want to, simply clone the repository open the `index.html` file in a modern browser (Chrome or Edge recommended for Web Serial support).
