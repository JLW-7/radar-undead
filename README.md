**Radar Undead** is a thrilling, interactive zombie radar game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players defend themselves from zombies appearing both randomly and via sensor input from an Arduino, tracking them on a radar and shooting them down before they reach the center danger zone. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Radar Display**: A semicircular radar shows approaching zombies with real-time angle and distance updates.  
- **Arduino Integration**: Zombies can spawn based on objects detected by an Arduino sensor.  
- **Sensor & Random Spawning**: Zombies appear both randomly and via Arduino sensor input.  
- **Interactive Shooting**: Click on the radar to shoot zombies and earn points.  
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard modes affect zombie spawn rates and challenge.  
- **Health Management**: Zombies reaching the center zone reduce player health. Game ends when health reaches zero.  
- **Immersive Audio**: Custom gunshot, zombie hit, groans, victory, and game-over sounds using Web Audio API.  
- **Responsive Visual Effects**: Pulsing zombies, distance indicators, and center danger zone highlights.
